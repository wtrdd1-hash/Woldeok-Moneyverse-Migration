## Mandatory cycle record
Every planning review records start/mid-work `origin/main` exact SHA, authority-version drift, reviewed detailed specs and release/work records, gap IDs with severity, evidence and acceptance gates, EN/KO parity, and whether any implementation/Test/Production claim is actually evidenced. Historical decisions are preserved and superseded explicitly rather than deleted.

## v2026.09.22.368 — 2026-09-22
- Start SHA: `3f42ad8c6b12c8e13693ff246935eebceab951e1`.
- Mid-work SHA: `3f42ad8c6b12c8e13693ff246935eebceab951e1` (stable).
- Authority drift: PROJECT_PLAN v352 vs main release evidence v360.
- Reviewed: PROJECT_PLAN EN/KO, INTEGRATED_REVIEW_V348 EN/KO, UPDATE_LOG EN/KO, v359/v360 release evidence, mobile complete API contract, current admin TOTP/runtime migration evidence, and remote admin-shop reauth candidate.
- G368-01 P1: authority/version drift; later release notes do not silently override planning acceptance.
- G368-02 P0: admin TOTP was retired by migration/runtime evidence but remains stated as a current control in authoritative/detailed planning; do not count it as deployed without new runtime+DB evidence.
- G368-03 P1: mobile/API contract mixes old v2026.09.14.2/52-controller/163-endpoint material with v359 57-controller/335-backend/179-mobile material; require exact-SHA semantic machine diff and EN/KO sync.
- G368-04 P1: `auto/hourly-b-shop-stepup-v2026.09.22.366` is unmerged WIP evidence; acceptance requires current-main rebase, negative reauth/role/CSRF tests, audit and concurrency/idempotency evidence, EN/KO sync and merged exact-SHA Test proof.
- G368-05 P1: v360 session-count/zero-downtime evidence is release-specific and does not by itself prove all auth/CSRF/reauth/critical-mutation continuity.
- External refresh: OWASP ASVS 5.0.0 latest stable; NIST SP 800-63B-4 final July 2025, with periodic reauthentication/session-timeout requirements.
- Decision: planning/docs only. No new implementation, Test or Production completion is claimed.
