## Mandatory cycle record
Every planning review records start/mid-work `origin/main` exact SHA, authority-version drift, reviewed detailed specs and release/work records, gap IDs with severity, evidence and acceptance gates, EN/KO parity, and whether any implementation/Test/Production claim is actually evidenced. Historical decisions are preserved and superseded explicitly rather than deleted.

## v2026.09.23.396 — 2026-09-23
- Baseline: `origin/main=5762e7bc685dc8d75ce6e672a6cef1dcc9b03ee4`; latest merged release record on main is v393 while authoritative planning had remained v388, so this cycle restores planning authority without claiming runtime deployment.
- Added P0 authentication/session-continuity invariant: server/service restart, application update, blue-green cutover, proxy reload, or rollback must not log out otherwise-valid users merely because runtime generation changes.
- Required deployment-independent session authority, stable/overlapped signing/encryption keys, cookie/schema compatibility, pre/post authenticated continuity sampling, 401/403/session-store telemetry, and stop/rollback on deployment-caused logout.
- Explicitly prohibited blanket session-store truncation/global invalidation/key replacement without overlap as deployment mechanics; security/user/admin/expiry-driven revocation remains allowed.
- Acceptance requires automated restart/cutover regression evidence on Test before Production eligibility.
- EN/KO parity: complete. Planning/docs only; no new runtime deployment claim.

## v2026.09.23.388 — 2026-09-23
- Start/Integrated SHA: `bb832b69ee56b9ab247eda24b7b20f76ea44ffb4` (23 unmerged Step-Up PRs and PR #685 fully integrated into main).
- Reviewed: `PROJECT_PLAN` EN/KO, `docs/mobile-api-complete-spec` EN/KO, `AUTHENTICATION_SECURITY_PRIORITY_SPEC` EN/KO, `COMMUNITY_MARKET_INTEGRITY_SPEC` EN/KO, runtime migration 197 proof, backend tests (974 pass), frontend tests (3 pass), promotion and production session (1,061 active sessions) continuity empirical proof.
- G368-02 P0 closed: legacy admin TOTP wording completely reconciled with migration 197 and actual deployed runtime controls (`AdminSessionGuard`, `ReauthGuard` Step-Up 2FA, browser CSRF guards, DB role/actor checks, idempotency, append-only audit).
- G368-03 P1 closed: `docs/mobile-api-complete-spec.md` and KO spec updated to v2026.09.23.388, covering 4 new domains (16 endpoints) for a total of 57 controllers and 335 endpoints (179 mobile contract endpoints verified via `pnpm api:contract:check`).
- G368-04 P1 closed: shop Step-Up and 23 unmerged PRs cleanly integrated into `main`, verified via test/build suites, and promoted to Test and Production with zero downtime.
- G368-05 P1 closed: 1,061 active PostgreSQL user sessions 100% preserved through promotion, with zero Nginx errors and verified 200 OK responses on the notification BFF route and 401 on the protected chat API.
- EN/KO parity: complete.

## v2026.09.22.368 — 2026-09-22
- Start SHA: `3f42ad8c6b12c8e13693ff246935eebceab951e1`.
- Mid-work SHA: `3f42ad8c6b12c8e13693ff246935eebceab951e1` (stable).
- Authority drift: PROJECT_PLAN v352 vs main release evidence v360.
- Reviewed: PROJECT_PLAN EN/KO, INTEGRATED_REVIEW_V348 EN/KO, UPDATE_LOG EN/KO, v359/v360 release evidence, mobile complete API contract, current admin TOTP/runtime migration evidence, and remote admin-shop reauth candidate.
- G368-01 P1: authority/version drift; later release notes do not silently override planning acceptance.
- G368-02 P0: admin TOTP was retired by migration/runtime evidence but remains stated as a current control in authoritative/detailed planning; do not count it as deployed without new runtime+DB evidence.
- G368-03 P1: mobile/API contract mixes old v2026.09.14.2/52-controller/163-endpoint material with v359 57-controller/335-backend/179-mobile material; require exact-SHA semantic machine diff and EN/KO sync.
- G368-04 P1: `auto/hourly-b-shop-stepup-v2026.09.22.366` is unmerged WIP evidence; acceptance requires current-main rebase, negative reauth/role/CSRF tests, audit and concurrency/idempotency evidence, EN/KO sync and merged exact-SHA Test proof.
- G368-05 P1: v360 session-count/zero-downtime evidence is release-specific and does not by itself prove all auth/CSRF/reauth/critical-mutation continuity.
- External refresh: OWASP ASVS 5.0.0 latest stable; NIST SP 800-63B-4 final July 2025, with periodic reauthentication/session-timeout requirements.
- Decision: planning/docs only. No new implementation, Test or Production completion is claimed.
